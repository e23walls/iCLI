iCLI
====

A UNIX-like shell for iOS.

I wasn't originally planning to create a repo for this project, but after realizing I couldn't market this app (Apple doesn't like apps which allow direct access to the filesystem), I didn't put it on the App Store. It runs on my iPhone and iPad, however, so ask for a demo.


iCLI = iCommand Line Interface
